/**
 * A Stage in a staged event-driven architecture
 * The Stage class consists of a queue of events and a link to a
 * Threadpool.  The threads in the pool handle the events on the queue.
 * The key method of the Stage class is handle_event(), which is abstract.
 * Each subclass of Stage will fill in the handle_event() method with
 * appropriate code for that stage. The expected behavior of handle_event()
 * is to perform stage-specific processing for the event argument, and
 * complete by passing the event on to the queue of the next appropriate
 * stage. Occasionally, handle_event may cause a new event to be created,
 * or the current event to be freed.  The generic Stage class handles
 * maintenance of the event queue, and scheduling the stage on the runqueue
 * of the Threadpool as long as events are in the queue.
 * Subclasses of Stage may also add data members that represent
 * stage-specific state and are accessed from the handle_event() method.
 * <p>
 * A stage can register a callback on an event that it passes to another
 * stage later in the pipeline.  When the callback is invoked, it calls
 * the callback_event() virtual function from the stage that set the
 * callback.
 * <p>
 * An event is an argument to the handle_event() method.
 * The Event class is generic and is intended to be specialized by
 * subclasses in order to represent real events.  handle_event() is
 * expected to use C++ introspection (dynamic cast) to determine the
 * specific sub-class of event that it is dealing with on each invocation.
 * <p>
 * After a Stage is constructed, nothing happens because the stage is not
 * yet initialized.  At this point the queue is empty and the stage is not
 * yet connected to any Threadpool or Stage pipeline.  In general, init
 * and configuration of stages is handled by the SedaConfig class which
 * picks up configuration information from a central config file.  Processing
 * for the stage does not start until the SedaConfig class calls connect().
 * connect() hooks the stage up to a Threadpool and connects the output of
 * the stage to the input of some other stages. A single Threadpool can be
 * dedicated to a single Stage, or multiple Stages can share the same
 * Threadpool.  disconnect() performs the opposite task, breaking the
 * connection between a Stage and its Threadpool and pipeline successors.
 * disconnect is currently called by the SedaConfig object on each Stage
 * in the pipeline when the SedaConfig object is destroyed.
 *
 * There are three virtual functions that allow a stage class to customize
 * the initialization/finalization process.  set_properties() is called
 * by the SedaConfig object immediately after the stage is created, and
 * is used to pass stage-specific configuration options via a Properties
 * class.  initialize() is called from connect().  The purpose of
 * initialize() is to allow the stage class to verify that the next_stage_list_
 * contains valid stages (number, type, etc), and to initialize any stage
 * state (such as aliases for members of the next stage list) prior to
 * stage connection.  cleanup() is called from disconnect to allow the
 * stage class to release resources before entering the disconnected state.
 * initialize() and cleanup() should be coded so that a stage can be
 * repeatedly disconnected then re-connected and continue to function
 * properly.
