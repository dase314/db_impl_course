/**
 * A generic CompletionCallback
 * A completion callback object provides a function that should be
 * invoked when an event has made it successfully through the stage
 * pipeline.  Usually, each event will reference a completion callback,
 * and before an event is deleted, the stage doing the deletion should
 * invoke the "done()" event method.  This method eventually invokes the
 * "callback_event()" method in the stage which set the callback, providing
 * a reference to the event as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the callback is to allow a stage to register some
 * processing for an event that is delayed until after the event has
 * progressed all the way through the stage pipeline.  Callbacks can be
 * chained.  Typically, each stage in the pipeline might add a callback
 * to an event's callback chain before passing the event to the next stage.
 * When the "done()" method is finally invoked, the callback on top of the
 * callback stack is invoked.  It becomes the responsibility of this callback
 * to either forward the event to another stage for more processing, or
 * to eventually call done() again of the event.  In this way, with each
 * callback on the stack eventually invoking the next callback on the stack,
 * all the callbacks are eventually executed. Each callback
 * can have an optional context associated with it.  This context is
 * provided to the stage callback function when it is invoked.  It is
 * opaque to the callback object.
 * <p>
 * By default, the callback will run on the thread of the stage that created
 * the callback.  If the stage that is calling done() on the event wants
 * to execute the callback stack in place, it can call the done_immediate()
 * interface.  Note that this will execute the *entire* callback stack on
 * the current thread.
