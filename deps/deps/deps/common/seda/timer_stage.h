 *  To request that an event be triggered in the future, the user
 *  should submit a \c TimerRegisterEvent that include the event to be
 *  triggered and the time (in either absolute or relative form) when
 *  it should be triggered.  If the user sets the callback of the \c
 *  TimerRegisterEvent, the \c TimerStage will return to the user a

 *
 *  To cancel a registered timer event, the user should submit a \c
 *  TimerCancelEvent that includes the token returned to the user in
 *  the previous \c TimerRegisterEvent.  If the request to cancel the
 *  event reaches the \c TimerStage before the event is triggered, the
 *  \c TimerStage will cancel the event.  The \c TimerStage will
 *  report, via the callback of the \c TimerCancelEvent, whether the
 *  event was successfully cancelled.
 *
 *  The \c TimerStage will invoke the callback of an event when the
 *  time requested by \c TimerRegisterEvent is reached.  A callback
 *  will never be invoked before the requested time; the punctuality
 *  of the event triggering will depend on the load on the system.
 *
 *  Implementation note: The \c TimerStage creates an internal thread
